//*        SYSOUT, using SYSLOG format, the contents of the         *   FILE 513

//*        We found this program missed some options, that could    *   FILE 513

//*        reasons, not to write a new program, but to upgrade      *   FILE 513
//*        IEAMDBLG. Our version of the module, is fully            *   FILE 513

//*        We introduced four new options: COPY(ALL), COPY(MDB),    *   FILE 513

//*        This new version of the program is SMPE installable.     *   FILE 513
//*        You can find a SYSMOD sample in member @MVSX08. This     *   FILE 513

//*        interactively from ISPF, but this number can be          *   FILE 513
//*        easily changed, and this notation is useful to           *   FILE 513
//*        dyanamically allocate the data we need.                  *   FILE 513

//*        As referred to in APAR PQ07414, SDSF gets slow           *   FILE 513

//*        much better to search MDBs within the unloaded data      *   FILE 513
//*        on DASD, using the accompanying VERLOG facility from     *   FILE 513
//*        ISPF.                                                    *   FILE 513

//*        New MDB records can be accessed by browsing directly     *   FILE 513

//*        as usual, with the aid of search arguments: sysids,      *   FILE 513
//*        start-date-time to end-date-time, and so on, making      *   FILE 513
//*        it ieasier accessing to LOG data. Search results can     *   FILE 513
//*        be put into a file, if you want, and you can save        *   FILE 513
//*        this selected log data for later use: i.e. reporting     *   FILE 513

//*        You can use clist VERLOG to start the search. Two        *   FILE 513
//*        panels, (members VLOGP00 and VLOGH00) and a program      *   FILE 513

//*        but we think it will not be a complex task for           *   FILE 513

//*        operlog and so on .... Of course this ISPF aplication    *   FILE 513
//*        will take into account differences between LOCAL and     *   FILE 513
