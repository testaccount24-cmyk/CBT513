+ %INFORMATION about TIME (hours)
+     MDB records are written in the Operlog Log Stream as they are
+     sent from the system connected to it. It is possible to find some
+     delay between the time the MDB record is written by the system
+     and the time it is processed by Operlog.
+     For example, at IPL time, MDB records are temporarily stored in
+     the CONSOLE buffer, until the system IPLing gets its OPERLOG
+     connection active.
